Silent Guardian: AI Personal Privacy Firewall Agent
Silent Guardian is like your digital bodyguard that quietly watches over your online and device activities — but unlike traditional firewalls or antivirus software, it uses advanced AI reasoning to understand the context of what’s happening with your data and privacy.

It doesn’t just block or allow apps blindly. Instead, it:

Knows which apps or websites are safe or risky

Understands when an app tries to access sensitive data like your microphone, camera, location, or clipboard

Learns your personal privacy preferences and habits over time

Warns you about suspicious activity before it harms you

Can take smart actions on your behalf (block, obfuscate data, fake info, restrict permissions)

The agent runs silently in the background, monitoring data flows and app activities on your device and browser.

It watches network calls, file access, camera/mic usage, clipboard, location requests, app permissions, etc.

It logs these activities for further analysis.
